# React Context LocalStorage + TypeScript

The react-context-global-store is a global state management library built on the **React Context API** (React version 16 or above).Using it you can build a global state repository just like redux and reference these global states in a simple way in your internal business components. It's very small (less than 300 lines after packaging) and has a clean API.
